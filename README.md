# What?

This is a simple checklist iOS and Mac app that supports:
* Checklist items. These do not get deleted after being checked, so they can be reused. For example: camping checklist
* Todo list. These are items that get deleted after being checked. For example: wash car
* By logging in with your Apple id it will sync todo items across macOS and iOS

# Why?
I got fed up with having to abandon one app after another when they either added advertising or paid features I did not need.

# Platforms
Currently supports iOS and MacOs

# TODOs
* It'd be nice to be able to share a checklist between users
* Manually ordering of the items
* Icon
* Publish to app store I guess
